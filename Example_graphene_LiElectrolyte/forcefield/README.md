Place your lithium electrolyte force field and residue templates here.

Suggested filenames used by the example scripts:
- `li_fixed_charge.xml` / `li_fixed_charge_residues.xml` for the fixed-charge test.
- `li_mpid.xml` / `li_mpid_residues.xml` for the MPIDForce polarizable system.

Also store the small building-block PDB files referenced by the Packmol input (e.g., Li salt ion pair, solvent molecules, additives).
If you follow the provided Packmol template, include graphene electrode coordinates as `graphene_top.pdb` and `graphene_bottom.pdb`.
